What is Alpha
=============

 The MIT course "Computation Structures" defines an abstract
machine called Beta. They also provide a simulator called BSim.
Alpha aims to be a fully compatible, high speed, beta machine
implementation with display emulation.

 Whereas BSim, Alpha is not (yet) an assembler. It takes binary
programs produced by BSim un run them.

How to compile/run Alpha?
=========================

 Alpha is written in scala using sbt (Simple Build Tool). Just
type:

# sbt run

 at the prompt to run Alpha.


How to run beta programs?
=========================

 First open your file with BSim, and assemble it to get ".bin" file.
Then run Alpha, open this ".bin" file, and press "Executer". The "Ecran"
tab display the screen.


Licence?
========

Alpha is free (as in freedom) software, licenced under the terms of
the GNU General Public Licence Third version or any later. You can find

Howto deploy it?
================

 Alpha is compatible is tested on openjdk-6 and 7. To deploy it,
proguard and m4 needs to be installed. Simply type:
